    <h2> Defining what a file is </h2>
    <p> A file path is exactly what it sounds like; a path to a file. As you probably know, computers have a file system
        that organizes files. Every file has a unique location that it does not share with any other file.<br>
        <dl style="list-style-type:circle">
            <caption> When we say the word file in everyday use, we are refering to one of two types of files:</caption>
            <dt> <strong>Directories</strong></dt>
            <dd> Files that hold other files </dd>
            <dt> <strong>Files</strong> </dt>
            <dd> Files with content, such as a text or word document.</dd>
        </dl>

    <h2>Absolute and relative file paths</h2>
    <p> An absolute file path is location of the file on the computer for
        example:<br>"C:\Users\ben\Documents\example.txt"<br>
        A relative file path is the location of one file relative to the location of another.
        A relative file path will not often not be a top down path as shown above. Sometimes you have to
        go up then over. To go up in the file system, put two periods ".." in the path. This will be shown in
        the following example:</p>
    Consider the following file structure:
    <img src="images/relative file path example.JPG" width="500" height="500" style="float:left">

    <p>Two files are in a system with multiple directories. The absolute paths of the files are, from top down:
        'C/Users/ben/Documents/HTML-Tutorial/23 File Paths.htm' and 'C/Users/ben/Documents/JavaScript-Tutorial/1 Change
        HTML Elements.htm'
        <pre>
        To get from the file "23 File Paths.htm" to "1 Change HTML Elements.htm", the relative path would be:
        "../JavaScript-Tutorial/1 Change HTML Elements.htm"
        .. means go up in the file system, so in this case it means exit the 'HTML-Tutorial' Directory.
